Nexus 0.0 User Guide

Welcome to Nexus!
Team Nexus Presents: a simple, OS-like command interface with math and variable functionality. Type 'h' or 'help' in the shell to view the help menu at any time.

Getting Started

Run the program:
python nexus.py

You will see the welcome message:
Welcome to Nexus! Type 'h' or 'help' to access the help menu.

Enter commands at the Nexus> prompt.

Core Commands

exit or e - Ends the current Nexus session
uid - Displays your session's unique ID (persistent for the session)
time - Displays the current system time (HH:MM:SS)
ver - Displays the current Nexus version (0.0)

Math Commands

All math commands store the result in [ans], which can be reused in subsequent calculations:

add [a] [b] - Adds two numbers
sub [a] [b] - Subtracts second number from first
mul [a] [b] - Multiplies two numbers
div [a] [b] - Divides first number by second (division by zero not allowed)

Notes:

Arguments must be in [ ], e.g., [5].

[ans] can be used as an argument to reuse the previous answer. Example:
add [3] [4] → [ans] = 7
mul [2] [ans] → [ans] = 14

Variable Commands

Nexus supports 26 single-letter variables (a–z). All unset variables default to 0.0.

addvar [var] [value] - Sets a variable [a]–[z] to a value
listvar - Lists all variables and their current values (0.0 if unset)
resetvar - Clears all variables or only specified ones: resetvar [a]

Example:
addvar [x] [10] → sets [x] = 10
add [5] [x] → result = 15 stored in [ans]
resetvar [x] → clears [x], all others remain
listvar → shows [x] = 0.0, others as set or 0.0

Tips

Every number or variable reference must be enclosed in [ ].

[ans] allows chaining calculations efficiently.

Use 'e' as a quick exit shortcut.

listvar always displays all variables a–z, even if unset.

This concludes the Nexus 0.0 Guide — a foundation for math operations, variables, and basic OS-like commands.
